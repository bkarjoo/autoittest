The making of the box_loc.csv file

Copy from blackbox tree into excel.
Delete all columns except box Name.
Create 3 columns before box name column.

Columns :
1 - quant number (1 or 2)
2 - folder number
3 - box number within the foler
4 - box name

Each time a change is made such as boxes being moved around, there must be an adjustment
to the box_name.csv as well.

Exclude archived boxes. You don't want them to be used for back tests.
